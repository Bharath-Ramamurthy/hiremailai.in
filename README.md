## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Does HireMail AI send applications without my approval?**  
**A:** No. Every application is prepared as a draft and requires your explicit review and approval before sending. You have full control.

**Q: How is this different from other job application tools?**  
**A:** Most tools use single-prompt AI or simple templates. HireMail AI uses a coordinated multi-agent system with specialized agents for each task, resulting in higher quality outputs. The Auto-Diagnostic Agent also ensures 60% better reliability.

**Q: Which AI models do you use?**  
**A:** We support multiple providers (OpenAI, Mistral, Gemini, Hugging Face) through a factory pattern, allowing automatic failover and cost optimization.

**Q: Is my resume data secure?**  
**A:** Yes. Data is encrypted, and we're completing Gmail API security assessment. You can delete your data anytime.

**Q: When can I use this?**  
**A:** Public beta launch is targeted for Q3 2026, pending completion of security reviews.

**Q: Will this work with ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)?**  
**A:** Yes. Resumes are formatted to be ATS-friendly, and the tailoring process maintains proper structure and keywords.
